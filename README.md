### Hi there! I'm Austin!

![Visitors](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=riigess.riigess)

Here's how to pronounce my username: Riigess /Ree-j-eh-s/.
- 🔭 I’m currently working at a major technology company.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Kotlin RESTful APIs, iOS App Development, and UI/UX design. Turns out, I can't stand C#/C++ development or its developers. (Unrelated to an interview that occurred recently. Apologies if you feel it's tightly related to you, a previous interviewer of mine. It's not.)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with learning more about iOS and macOS development, what additional communities should I join?
- 👀 Looking for a new DevOps and OSS platforms that aren't Microsoft-related, starting to settle on a TODO markdown file and intermittently syncing changes from a local git server
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him

# Oh, yeah
AI is about as useful as a burnt slice of bread. Copilot, ChatGPT, etc, could all die off and actively benefit humanity in a week. Just sayin'.
